<h2>10. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
<p>This Terms of Use and your use of the Site, the App, and the Smart Contracts are governed by and constructed in accordance with the laws of Cayman IslandsRepublic of Estonia applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed in the Cayman Island, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.</p>
<h2>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>11.1 Informal negotiations</p>
<p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a &ldquo;Dispute" and collectively, the &ldquo;Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a &ldquo;Party" and collectively, the &ldquo;Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
<p>11.2 Binding Arbitration</p>
<p>If a Party is unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (&ldquo;AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitration compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all the arbitration fees and expenses. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AA rules or applicable law, the arbitration can take place in the Cayman Islands. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgement on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in the Cayman Islands, and the Parties hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.</p>
<p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site, the App and the Smart Contracts be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of the action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
<p>11.3 Exceptions to the Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</p>
<p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provision concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, and of the intellectual property rights of a Party, (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal and unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed or jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<p>C. The App does not store, send, or receive Fear NFTs. This is because Fear NFTs exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App&rsquo;s supporting blockchain on the Polygon network. Any transfer of Fear NFTs occurs only on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>D. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.

<p>F. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Fear ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Fear NFTs.</p>
